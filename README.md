The project is compatible with "Python v3.9.7"

You can find the other required packages in the _requirements.txt_, which can be found in the repository's root folder.

You must create a new environment and install the required libraries from the ``requirements.txt`` file to run the program. You can make the environment in the computer labs by running the following command:

`python -m venv my_env`

Then to activate the virtual environment:

`source ./my_env/bin/activate`

Or if you are in Windows just type:

`activate`

And install the files from the requirements.txt file

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
