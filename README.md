The project is compatible with "Python v3.10.0"

You can find the other required packages in the _requirements.txt_, which can be found in the repository's root folder.

You must create a new environment and install the required libraries from the ``requirements.txt`` file to run the program. You can make the environment in the computer labs by running the following command:

`python3 -m venv my_env`

Then to activate the virtual environment:

`source ./my_env/bin/activate`

And install the files from the requirements.txt file

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you are using `conda` you can follow the next steps:

`conda create --name myenv python=3.10.0`

Then you can install with pip the requirements.txt file:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
